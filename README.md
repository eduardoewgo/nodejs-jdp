# nodejs-jdp
Mocking data in unit testing - JDP.

# Objective
Understand the most used mocking functions and experiment with it. Just for the sake of simplicty, instead of having `__tests__` folders under `controller` and `services`, 
we will use a top level test to consume those two files and see how mocking works.
